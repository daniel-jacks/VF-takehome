- Tuesday: Today was the first day working on this project. My biggest goal for EOD was getting a better understanding of how to interact with Amazon Connect, setting up my local environment in order to make building this as straightforward as possible, and finally, to have a UML laid out for me to reference going into the week (and make adjustments as I see fit). 

- Wednesday: Today my plan was to work a bit on the function I wanted to use in order to convert the numbers into vanity numbers. This ended up taking a bit longer than anticipated, but I got the function working. I also ended up getting locked out of my AWS management account, and took just about all day to resolve that due to how strict AWS is about MFA and their security measures.

- Thursday: Today I touched back on the function for the vanity numbers, and also did a bit more research into how I want to connect all the different AWS services. My AWS account is still locked out and I guess I will be granted access tonight. My big goal for tomorrow is to get the AWS services up and running and accepting calls and potentially saving numbers (not necessarily vanity numbers) to the DynamoDB instance. From there I will work on the efficiency of the Lambda as well as tightening up anything else over the weekend and at the start of the week.
