- Tuesday: Today was the first day working on this project. My biggest goal for EOD was getting a better understanding of how to interact with Amazon Connect, setting up my local environment in order to make building this as straightforward as possible, and finally, to have a UML laid out for me to reference going into the week (and make adjustments as I see fit).
